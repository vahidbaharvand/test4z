# Test4z DB2 Sample

Example use case scenario:

1. The test suite writes 10 random records to the DB2 database.
2. Within the job submission, the batch application selects the records from the DB2 table based on some filters and afterwards it updates the notification date of this particular subset of records to today.
3. It is expected to have n records that have notification date as today. An SQL query will be executed to pick these records and to assert the n number.
4. The test suite removes the 10 random rows within the cleanup process.


## Information
* To be able to run the tests, at least one of the following conditions must be fulfilled:
    1. z/OSMF system and DB2 system are on the same LPAR
    2. In the /supportive_cases/db2/setup/script.sh file, specify the DB2 system (ex: *JOBPARM SYSAFF=HB01)
